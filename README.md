# BachelorThesis
A Thesis Submitted to EEMCS Faculty Delft University of Technology, in Partial Fulfilment of the Requirements for the Bachelor of Computer Science and Engineering. Code for bachelor thesis.


# How to run
I am using a conda environment to run the code. It is running on wls 2 with ubuntu.

To use conda in wsl, you need to setup wsl fist, then install conda in wsl. Then you can create a conda environment and install the packages required.

After that, you can run the code in the environment.

First run the LCDB_loclised.py to get the curves required.

After which you can run check_error.ipynb to check metrics or run training_lcdb.ipynb to train the model.

If you have issues with the lcpfn, change all the `from lcpfn.lcpfn import *` to `from lcpfn import *` in the folder lcpfn.


# Additional information:

For experiment 2, you need the baseline (Last1 and mmf4). You can get it from the LCDB Github [repo](https://github.com/fmohr/lcdb/blob/main/publications/2022-ecml/analysis/3b%20-%20analysis%20of%20curve%20fits.ipynb)
follow the instruction to get the "df_total.gz" file. Then you can run the experiment 2 notebook. If you run it with getting the baseline you will only get the MSE for LCPFN.

Code for LCPFN from :
